# Heatstroke Prevention Challenge
This repository contains the solution code for Heatstroke Prevention challenge, organized by 5th International Conference on Activity and Behavior Computing (ABC) ([https://abc-research.github.io/2023/]) the goal of the Heatstroke Prevention Challenge as to forecast the personal thermal comfort sensations on the different days given past data (data can be found in challenge website: ([https://abc-research.github.io/challenge2023/](https://sites.google.com/view/heatstroke-challenge))).

We created a machine-learning model that can forecast the thermal sensations through selecting the best features. The details can be found our paper "Title: Predicting Heatstroke Risk and Preventing Health Complications Using Machine Learning and Physiological Data". 

If you find our code use, please cite the following article.
