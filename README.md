# Heatstroke Prevention Challenge
This repository contains our solution code for Heatstroke Prevention challenge, organized by 5th International Conference on Activity and Behavior Computing (ABC) [ABC2023](https://abc-research.github.io/2023/).
# Challenge Overview
The primary objective of the Heatstroke Prevention Challenge is to develop a predictive model for personal thermal comfort sensations based on historical data. The dataset used for this challenge can be accessed on the challenge website: [Heatstroke Challenge Data](https://sites.google.com/view/heatstroke-challenge).

In this repository, we present our machine-learning solution that forecasts thermal sensations by employing a carefully selected set of features. For an in-depth understanding of our methodology, please refer to our paper titled "Predicting Heatstroke Risk and Preventing Health Complications Using Machine Learning and Physiological Data."
